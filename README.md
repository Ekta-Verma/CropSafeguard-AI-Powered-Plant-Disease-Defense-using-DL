# Plant Disease Detection with Deep Learning
A deep learning project for detecting plant diseases using TensorFlow and Keras, inspired by the research paper:- R. Zambare, C. Awati, R. Deshmukh and S. Shirgave, "A Theoretical Study on CNN based Cotton Crop Disease Detection," 2022 6th International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI), Tirunelveli, India, 2022, pp. 1062-1066, doi: 10.1109/ICOEI53556.2022.9777219.

## Introduction
CropSafeguard is a cutting-edge project dedicated to protecting crops from diseases using the power of artificial intelligence. Our primary focus is on potatoes, but the implications of this work extend to agricultural health and global food security.
